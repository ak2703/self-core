hello.comment=Hi @%s! I'm the Project Manager of this project. I take care of Issues' assignments, payments and more.\
              Want me to work for your project too? Go [here](https://self-xdsd.com). \n\n\
              I work primarily at Github, but I'll also start working at GitLab and BitBucket soon. 
newIssue.comment=@%s thank you for reporting this. I'll assign someone to take care of it soon.
reopened.comment=@%s thanks for reopening this, I'll find someone to take a look at it again. \n\
                 However, please keep in mind that reopening tickets is a bad practice. Next time, please \
                 open a new ticket.
noAssigneeFound.comment=@%s I couldn't find any assignee for this task. This is either because there are \
                        no contributors with role ``%s`` available or because the project does not have enough funds.\n\n\
                        Please, make sure there is at least one available contributor with the required role and \
                        the project can afford to pay them.
taskAssigned.comment=@%s this is your task now, please go ahead. Deadline (when this ticket should be closed) \
                     is ``%s``.\n\n\
                     Estimation here is ``%s minutes``, that's how much you will be paid.\n\n\
                     Remember, you don't have to solve everything in this ticket - you can solve it partially\
                     and leave ``@todo`` markers in the code, which will become future tasks.
